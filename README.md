  ## Installation
  1. Download / Clone the repository. 
  2. Navigate to the root of the downloaded / cloned repository with a CLI. Then, type 'npm install' and press the enter key.

  ### Usage
  1. Either type 'npm start' in the CLI at the root of the directory to start the app locally (navigate to localhost:3000 in a browser if using locally), or use the link              provided above to go to the deployed app. 
  2. At this point a user may download the application from their browser. 
  3. Enter an amount of money and a name (e.g. Payday, 2000) and press the 'Add Funds' button. 
  4. From here a user is able to add their expenses and press the 'Subtract Funds' button. 
  5. The graph below the input fields will update as a user adds more information. 
  6. The app can be used even without a network connection by utilising indexedDB, once a network connection has been reestablished the data stored in indexedDB will be sent to      the mongoDB databse.
